6. Your License Grant to Logitech.

You will supply Logitech with the source code to the most recent version of Your Modifications upon Logitech's request.

7. Versions of the Agreement. Logitech may publish revised versions of this Agreement from time to time.  Each new version will be given a distinguishing version number. Once Original Code has been published under a particular version of this Agreement, You may continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Original Code under the terms of any subsequent version of this Agreement published by Logitech.  No one other than Logitech has the right to modify the terms of this Agreement.

8. NO WARRANTIES OR SUPPORT.  The Covered Code may contain in whole or in part pre-release, untested, or not fully tested software.  Logitech does not warrant that the Covered Code will meet Your requirements, that the Covered Code will operate in the combinations that You may select for use, that the operation of the Covered Code will be error-free or uninterrupted or that all errors in the Covered Code will be corrected.  You expressly acknowledge and agree that use of the Covered Code, or any portion thereof, is at Your sole and entire risk. THE ORIGINAL CODE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT WARRANTY, UPGRADES, OR SUPPORT OF ANY KIND AND LOGITECH AND LOGITECH'S LICENSOR(S) EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NONINFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING, USAGE, OR TRADE.  NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY LOGITECH OR A LOGITECH AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE WILL CREATE A WARRANTY HEREUNDER.  You acknowledge that the Covered Code is not intended for use in the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation, communication systems, or air traffic control machines.

9. Confidentiality.  You acknowledge that You will acquire information and materials from Logitech and knowledge about Logitech's business, products, customers, clients, and suppliers and that all such knowledge, information, and materials acquired are and will be Logitech's trade secrets and confidential and proprietary information (collectively "Confidential Information").  Confidential Information will not include, however, any information that (i) is received by You from a third party without restriction on use or disclosure, (ii) Logitech gives to third parties without restriction on use or disclosure, or (iii) is previously known to You or independently developed by You.  For a period of five (5) years following the receipt of any Confidential Information hereunder You agree to use reasonable efforts to hold all such Confidential Information in confidence, and not to disclose it to others or use it except as necessary for the performance of this Agreement.

10. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LOGITECH BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS LICENSE OR YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE COVERED CODE, OR ANY PORTION THEREOF, WHETHER UNDER A THEORY OF CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF LOGITECH HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY.  Some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation of liability of incidental or consequential damages, so this limitation may not apply to You.  In no event will Logitech's total liability to You for all damages (other than as may be required by applicable law) under this Agreement exceed the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00).

11. Trademarks. This Agreement does not grant any rights to use the trademarks or trade names "Logitech," "Jive," "Squeezebox," "Transporter," or any other trademarks, service marks, logos, or trade names belonging to Logitech (collectively "Logitech Marks"). You agree not to use any Logitech Marks in or as part of the name of products derived from the Original Code or to endorse or promote products derived from the Original Code other than as expressly permitted by and in strict compliance at all times with Logitech's third party trademark usage guidelines. 

12. Termination.
12.1. Termination. This Agreement and the rights granted hereunder will terminate:

(a) automatically without notice from Logitech if You fail to comply with any term(s) of this Agreement and fail to cure such breach within thirty (30) days of becoming aware of such breach;

(b) immediately in the event of the circumstances described in Section 13.6; or

(c) automatically without notice from Logitech if You, at any time during the term of this Agreement, commence an action for patent infringement against Logitech; provided that Logitech did not first commence an action for patent infringement against You in that instance.

12.2. Effect of Termination. Upon termination, You agree to immediately stop any further use, reproduction, modification, and preparation of derivative works of the Covered Code.  Provisions which, by their nature, should remain in effect beyond the termination of this Agreement will survive, including but not limited to Sections 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 13.2. Any sublicenses granted by Logitech under Section 6 prior to termination will survive any termination of this Agreement.  No party will be liable to any other for compensation, indemnity, or damages of any sort solely as a result of terminating this Agreement in accordance with its terms, and termination of this Agreement will be without prejudice to any other right or remedy of any party.

13. Miscellaneous.

13.1. Assignment.  You will have no right to assign this Agreement, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without Logitech's express prior written consent.  Any attempt to assign this Agreement, without such consent, will be null and of no effect.  Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of each party's successors and permitted assigns.

13.2. Government End Users.  The Original Code is "commercial computer software" as such term is used in FAR 12.212.  Any use, duplication, or disclosure of the Original Code by or on behalf of the U.S. Government is subject to restrictions as set forth in this Agreement.  Manufacturer is Logitech Europe S.A.

13.3. Relationship of Parties. The parties to this Agreement are independent contractors and this Agreement will not establish any relationship of partnership, joint venture, employment, franchise, or agency between the parties.  Neither party will have the power to bind the other or incur obligations on the other's behalf without the other's prior written consent.

13.4. Independent Development. Nothing in this Agreement will impair Logitech's right to acquire, license, develop, have others develop for it, market, or distribute technology or products that perform the same or similar functions as, or otherwise compete with, Modifications, Covered Code, technology, or products that You may develop, produce, market, or distribute.

13.5. Waiver; Construction. Failure by Logitech or any Contributor to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract will be construed against the drafter will not apply to this Agreement.

13.6. Severability.  If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this Agreement invalid or unenforceable, that provision of the Agreement will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if applicable law prohibits or restricts You from fully complying with Sections 2 and 6, or prevents the enforceability of either of those Sections, this Agreement will immediately terminate and You must immediately discontinue any use of the Original Code and destroy all copies of it that are in Your possession or control.

13.7. Dispute Resolution. Any litigation or other dispute resolution between You and Logitech relating to this Agreement will take place in the Northern District of California, and You and Logitech hereby consent to the personal jurisdiction of, and venue in, the state and federal courts within that district with respect to this Agreement. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.

13.8. Entire Agreement; Governing Law. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement will be governed by the laws of the United States and the State of California, except that body of California law concerning conflicts of law.
