SETUPNETTEST_HELP
	EN	Use the scroll wheel to select a data rate to test at and leave the test running for a period of time.\n\nThe top graph shows the current network performance as a fraction of the test rate.\n\nThe lower graph shows the history of test results grouped into performance bands which are colour coded Red, Amber and Green.\n\nGood network performance is indicated by minimal dips in the top graph and only Green bars on the lower graph.\n\nIf you see frequent dips in the top graph and significant Red bars on the lower graph, network performance may not be acceptable for streaming at this data rate.
