Building on Linux
=================

This was tested using Windows XP SP2, with Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 Professional Edition. Instructions for building with the Visual C++ Express (free) can be found at http://wiki.slimdevices.com/index.cgi?BuildingJiveOnVCExpress.


## Instructions:

To build:

1. Open the Jive.sln file in Microsoft Visual Studio.

2. Press Ctrl-Shift-B to build the solution.

3. In the 'debug' or 'release' folder you'll find the jive.exe executable that can be run.


TODO: creating a windows installer. I have had problems making the executable run on another PC. Patches please!
